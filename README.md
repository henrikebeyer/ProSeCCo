## Overview
**ProSeCCo** is a dataset and codebase for **self-contradiction detection in dialogue**.  
It is the first corpus to combine:
- **Naturally occurring dialogue** (debates, online forums, panel discussions)  
- **Propositional reconstructions** (context-resolved statements derived from *Inference Anchoring Theory*)  

The repository provides:
- The **dataset** (JSONL/TSV format)  
- **Annotation guidelines**  
- **Baseline experiments** and training scripts  
- **Error analysis** and **comparative corpus analysis** tools  
- Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) materials

## Dataset Contents

Each record contains:
- `id`: unique identifier  
- `speaker_id`: anonymized speaker code  
- `locution_1`, `locution_2`: original utterances  
- `proposition_1`, `proposition_2`: context-resolved propositions  
- `label`: `self-contradiction` / `no-contradiction`  
- `source`: original corpus (US2016, QT30, QT50)  
- `nodeset_id`: identifier of the nodeset in the source corpus  

### Example (JSON)
```json
{
"id": "QT30_094",
  "speaker_id": "speaker_063",
  "locution_1": "He was shaking hands with the staff.",
  "locution_2": "He was not.",
  "proposition_1": "Boris Johnson was shaking hands with the staff.",
  "proposition_2": "Boris Johnson was not shaking hands with coronavirus patients in a hospital.",
  "label": "no self-contradiction",
  "source": "QT30",
  "nodeset_id": "18507"
}
```
